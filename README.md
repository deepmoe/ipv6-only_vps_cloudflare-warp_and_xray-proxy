# ipv6-only_vps_cloudflare-warp_and_xray-proxy
Your IPv6 only VPS will derive IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking and Xray-based proxy.

The script help you automatically install CloudFlare-Warp and Xray from official sources. And the relative services will be started.

Please note that the script only supports Ubuntu and Debian. Moreover, I only test it on Ubuntu 22.04.

And if you place the problem like "How to access Github without IPv6", you will be recommended to download it and then upload it to your IPv6-only VPS via SFTP/FTP.
